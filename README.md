# HTML5-CSS-and-JavaScript

All projects on this folder have been made by me while doing my course in Responsive Web Design.

Each project  demonstrates my knowledge in HTML, CSS, and Javascript on the creation of webpages.

On the project named "Build_a_city_Skyline", the skyline changes from day to night depending on the size of the window.
Feel free to play around with the window size.

Any questions please feel free to contact me.
